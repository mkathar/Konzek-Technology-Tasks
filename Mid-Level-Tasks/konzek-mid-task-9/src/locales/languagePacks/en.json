The first computers occupied vast rooms and were only accessible to scientists. Over time, computers became smaller and more powerful. Microchips and circuits brought computers into everyone's homes. With the advent of the internet, people from all over the world connected, and the flow of information became faster than ever. Today, the small devices we carry in our pockets have replaced those massive machines. However, computers continue to remain the cornerstone of technological advancement.",
