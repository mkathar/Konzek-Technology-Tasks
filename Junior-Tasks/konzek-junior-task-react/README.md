## Junior Front-End Developer Task: React.js Application

### Task

1. Query a public GraphQL API and display the results in a list. The functionality is already provided, but you can modify the query as needed.

   - The code currently utilizes the public Countries API. More information can be found [here](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/countries/home?variant=current).

2. Create a text filter above the list to filter and group the results.

   - For example, entering "search:tt group:size" would search for results containing "tt" and group those results by the value of a "size" field.

3. Create items in the list that are selectable and deselectable by clicking on them. Only one item can be selected at a time.

   - The background color of the selected item should differ from that of unselected items.

   - The background color used for the selected item should be chosen from a predefined set of colors (which you should define yourself). Ensure that when an item is selected, the color is different from the previously selected item.

4. After loading the items and filtering, automatically select the 10th item, or the last one if the number of items is less than 10. The implementation should consider that the list can become very long.

### Additional Notes

- Utilize TypeScript where possible.
- You're permitted to use open-source packages as needed.
- Anything not mentioned in the description is up to you.
